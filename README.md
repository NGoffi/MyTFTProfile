# MyTFTProfile
Displays information about a players games played in TFT using the Riot Games API. Using this webpage I can see the results and details of my previous games played. The code uploaded to github does not contain any form of API key. This means that the webpage accessed here will not work as expected. https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/tft has more information on the API policy. I will be updating this project frequently and hope to soon get permission to use an API key outside of development.  

## Interface
If a button is visible but is not listed here it has no current function.
### suminfo
Takes the name entered into the search bar and uses riots API to return useful information, such as current rank.

### IC
Returns a list of all "Champions" (anything that can be placed/created on the board or bench falls under this category) from the last few sets of TFT.
