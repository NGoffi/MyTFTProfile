format for my tft project:

reuse code from my C++ version as I can for the JS version

implement to webpage functionality so user can see stats on board

1. create a list for each player
2. put champions/traits and their items into the list, attached
3. option 1: display each units stats on sheet on hover
3. option 2: open new page on user input to display team, where it is
easier for players to view each units individual stats.
